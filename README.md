  ### Mikrotik Domain Filter Script: Bash solution for filtering domain lists, creating Adlists and DNS Static or DNS FWD entries for Mikrotik RouterOS
</div>

---

## Introduction

**Mikrotik Domain Filter Script** is a robust Bash solution (designed to run on *nix systems, not on RouterOS) primarily designed for filtering and processing domain lists for [Mikrotik](https://mikrotik.com/) devices, enabling straightforward management of blocklists or allowlists. This script also adapts seamlessly to other network environments, making it suitable for a wide range of domain-based filtering tasks. By combining domain classification, DNS validation, and whitelist handling, this tool offers a comprehensive workflow to create accurate and reliable filtered lists, ensuring efficient network policy enforcement.

Furthermore, this script is an excellent fit for building and maintaining [Adlists](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/ROS/pages/37748767/DNS#DNS-Adlist), which are curated collections of domains serving advertisements. By returning the IP address `0.0.0.0` for ad-serving domain queries, the Adlist feature effectively null-routes unwanted content, improving user experience and reducing bandwidth usage.  
In addition, the script integrates seamlessly with [DNS Static](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/spaces/ROS/pages/37748767/DNS#DNS-DNSStatic) in Mikrotik RouterOS, allowing administrators to override specific DNS queries with custom entries, regular expressions, or dummy IP addresses for better control over DNS resolution. This functionality is particularly helpful for redirecting or blocking traffic at the DNS level—whether it’s entire zones or select domains.  
Lastly, the script can also aid in generating DNS FWD records, making it a comprehensive solution for all DNS-related configurations in a Mikrotik environment. The repository [includes an example script (dns-static-updater.rsc)](/scripts/dns-static-updater.rsc) specifically tailored for RouterOS, demonstrating how to load domain lists onto the router and form DNS FWD entries, ensuring an even smoother integration process.

### Initialization and Setup

- **Path Settings**: The script defines various paths for working directories, source files, output files, and temporary files.
- **Global Variables**: Variables for statistics like `TOTAL_DOMAINS`, `PROCESSED_DOMAINS`, and `VALID_DOMAINS` are declared.
- **Logging**: A logging mechanism is set up to record events and errors in a log file.
- **Lock Mechanism**: A file lock is used to ensure that only one instance of the script runs at a time, preventing conflicts.
- **Directory Initialization**: Required directories are checked and created if they don’t exist.
- **Dependency Check**: The script verifies the presence of required system tools like `curl`, `jq`, `grep`, `awk`, `sort`, and `parallel`.

### File Checks and Cleanup

- **Required Files**: The script checks for the existence of essential files like `sources.txt`, `sources_special.txt`, and others. If any are missing, the script exits with an error.
- **Cleanup**: Temporary files and outdated cache files are cleaned up to free up space and maintain script efficiency.

### Public Suffix List

- **Loading Public Suffix List**: The script downloads and updates the Public Suffix List if it’s outdated. This list is used to determine the type of domains (second-level, regional, etc.).
- The script utilizes the Mozilla Public Suffix List[^¹](https://publicsuffix.org/) - a standardized database of domain suffix information that helps properly identify the registrable domain parts.

### Domain Filtering and Classification

- **Initial Filtering**: Domains are filtered based on regex patterns to ensure they match the expected format. Invalid domains are discarded.
- **Domain Classification**: Domains are classified into second-level, regional, and other types. This involves parsing the domain, checking against the Public Suffix List, and categorizing accordingly.
- **Whitelist Application**: A whitelist of domains is applied to filter out domains that should not be blocked or allowed.

### DNS Checks  

- **Domain Validation**: Each domain is checked via DNS to ensure it resolves correctly. This involves sending a DNS query and verifying the response.  
- **Parallel Processing**: To improve efficiency, DNS checks are performed in parallel using the `parallel` tool. Results are stored in temporary files and aggregated.  
- **DNS Resolution Method**: Verification is performed using Cloudflare's DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) service[^¹](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/), which provides:  
  - Encrypted DNS queries  
  - JSON API support  
  - High reliability and performance  

**Endpoint**: `https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query`  

For detailed information about the API requests and response format, please refer to the [official documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/make-api-requests/dns-json/).

### Result Validation and Saving

- **Result Validation**: The final lists of domains are validated to ensure they meet the required format and are correctly classified.
- **Saving Results**: The validated domain lists are saved to output files. Backups are created before overwriting existing files to ensure data integrity.
- **Gist Update**: If the results are valid, the script updates GitHub Gists with the new domain lists.

### Update Checks and Backups

- **Update Needed Check**: The script checks if the source files have changed using MD5 checksums. If no changes are detected, the script exits early to save resources.
- **Backup Restoration**: If any step fails, the script restores backups of the output files to maintain the previous state.

### Pipeline Summary

1. **Initialization**: Set up paths, variables, and dependencies.
2. **File Checks**: Verify required files and clean up temporary files.
3. **Public Suffix List**: Load and update the Public Suffix List.
4. **Domain Filtering**:
   - Initial filter based on regex.
   - Classify domains into types.
   - Apply whitelist.
5. **DNS Checks**: Validate domains via DNS in parallel.
6. **Result Validation and Saving**:
   - Validate final domain lists.
   - Save results to output files.
   - Update GitHub Gists.
7. **Cleanup and Backup**: Clean temporary files and restore backups if needed.

This script ensures that domain lists are accurately filtered, validated, and updated, providing a robust solution for managing domain-based network policies.

- Internet connection for fetching domain lists  

#### Router Setup  
1. Import `dns-static-updater.rsc` to your MikroTik RouterOS  
2. Set appropriate permissions for the script execution  
3. Configure DNS settings on your router  
4. Ensure sufficient storage space for DNS list operations  

#### Script Variables Configuration  
The script requires configuration of the following variables:  

| Variable  | Description | Example |  
|-----------|-------------|---------|  
| `listname` | Name of the address-list for DNS entries | `"allow-list"` |  
| `fwdto` | DNS server address for query forwarding | `"localhost"` or `"1.1.1.1"` |  
| `url` | Raw URL of the domain list file | `"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/example/repo/main/domains.txt"` |  

#### Script Setup Instructions  
1. Set `:local listname` to your desired address-list name  
2. Set `:local fwdto` to your preferred DNS server  
3. Set `:local url` to the raw URL of your domain list  
4. Ensure the domain list file is accessible via the specified URL  

#### Important Notes  
- Use caution when adding large domain lists (beyond a few hundred domains)  
- Large lists might cause memory issues on some devices  
- The script adds a 10ms delay between operations to prevent resource exhaustion  
- Monitor system resources during initial setup with large lists
